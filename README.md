# Hi, I'm Zakariya

I have experience in the field of computer science and possess strong learning abilities. My expertise includes programming, design, and management of computer systems like Windows and Linux.

Due to my experience in cybersecurity, I am competent in some levels of professional hacking. I have received several training certificates in design, management and cybersecurity, but the majority of my learning was self-taught through the internet, which allowed me to achieve good results.
